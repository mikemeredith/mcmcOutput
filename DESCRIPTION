Description: Implements a class ('mcmcOutput') for efficiently storing and handling Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) output, intended as an aid for those writing customized MCMC samplers. A range of constructor methods are provided covering common output formats. Functions are provided to generate summary and diagnostic statistics and to display histograms or density plots of posterior distributions, for the entire output, or subsets of draws, nodes, or parameters.
