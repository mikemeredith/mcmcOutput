Description: Implements a class ('mcmcOutput') for efficiently storing and handling MCMC output. A range of constructor methods are provided covering common output formats used in other packages. Customized extractor methods allow an object of this class to behave as a data frame, a matrix, a 3-d array, or a sims.list. Other methods include window, print, plot, and summary.
